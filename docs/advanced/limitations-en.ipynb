    "# Limitations of ``brainscale``\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ``brainscale`` provides a powerful online learning compilation tool that can recognize most JAX primitives, it still has some limitations. The primary reason for these limitations is that ``brainscale`` struggles to effectively identify the relationships between hidden states $\\mathbf{g}$ and model parameters $\\theta$ when handling control flows and functionality enhancement transformations, which prevents its automatic compilation of eligibility traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, ``brainscale`` does not support the following JAX primitives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `jax.lax.cond`\n",
    "- `jax.lax.scan`\n",
    "- `jax.lax.while_loop`\n",
    "- `jax.vmap`\n",
    "- `jax.pmap`\n",
    "\n",
    "We are actively working to address these issues so that these features can be supported in future versions.\n",
