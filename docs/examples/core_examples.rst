Core examples
=============

Core examples are hosted on the GitHub repository in the `examples <https://github.com/chaobrain/brainscale/tree/main/examples>`__
directory.

Each example is designed to be **self-contained and easily forkable**.


These examples include:

- Recurrent spiking neural networks
- Feedforward convolutional spiking neural networks
- rate-based recurrent neural networks
- and more ...

Some of the examples below have a link "InteractiveðŸ•¹" that lets you run them
directly in Colab.
